Hi, I'm Yuqian Jiang, a 4th year PhD student in Computer Science at UT Austin. I'm in the [Learning Agents Research Group](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~larg/index.php/Learning_Agents_Research_Group) under the supervision of Prof. Peter Stone. I work on the [Building Wide Intelligence Project](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~larg/bwi_web/), and participate in [our RoboCup@Home team](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~AustinVilla/?p=athome). My research interests include robotics, reinforcement learning, multi-agent systems and human-robot interaction.  Outside of research, I enjoy watching basketball and playing the piano.
