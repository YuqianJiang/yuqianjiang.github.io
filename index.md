Hi, I'm Yuqian (Linda) Jiang. I am the Co-Founder and CTO of a robotics startup currently in stealth mode.

My research interests include service robotics, mobile manipulation, reinforcement learning, and task planning. I completed my Ph.D. in Computer Science at UT Austin. My PhD dissertation, [Towards Long-Term Deployment of General-Purpose Service Robots](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ytzEUoOSLtkD7eGfRoA5UIOF7IGax5EJ/view), explored how robots can operate autonomously and reliably over extended periods in dynamic environments. 

At UT Austin, I was a member of the [Learning Agents Research Group](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~larg/index.php/Learning_Agents_Research_Group) under the supervision of Prof. Peter Stone, where I led the [RoboCup@Home team](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~AustinVilla/athome/) and contributed to the [Building Wide Intelligence Project](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~larg/bwi_web/). 

I currently serve as a Co-Chair of the IEEE/RAS [Technical Committee on Mobile Manipulation](https://mobile-manipulation.net/).

I was honored to receive the [Silvia Coradeschi Award at RoboCup 2024](https://www.robocup.org/silvia_coradeschi) and the [J.P. Morgan PhD Fellowship](https://www.jpmorgan.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/research-awards/phd-fellowship-2021).

Outside of research, I like running, watching basketball, and playing the piano. I am a finisher of Marathon Pour Tous, the mass participation marathon of the Paris 2024 Olympic Games.
