Hi, I'm Yuqian Jiang, a PhD candidate in Computer Science at UT Austin. 

My research interests include robotics, reinforcement learning, multi-agent systems and human-robot interaction. My dissertation is on Task Planning and Learning for General-Purpose Service Robots. I'm in the [Learning Agents Research Group](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~larg/index.php/Learning_Agents_Research_Group) under the supervision of Prof. Peter Stone. I have worked on the [Building Wide Intelligence Project](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~larg/bwi_web/), and I am currently the team leader of our [RoboCup@Home team](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~AustinVilla/athome/). 

I was given the Silvia Coradeschi Award at [RoboCup 2024](https://cns.utexas.edu/news/features/robot-soccer-and-more-ut-students-best-competition-eindhoven). I am a grateful recipient of the [J.P. Morgan PhD Fellowship](https://www.jpmorgan.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/research-awards/phd-fellowship-2021).

Outside of research, I like running, watching basketball, and playing the piano. I am a finisher of Marathon Pour Tous, the mass participation marathon of the Paris 2024 Olympic Games.
